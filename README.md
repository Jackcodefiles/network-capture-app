# 🌐 Network Capture App

A **Streamlit + Playwright** tool to capture and analyze network requests in real-time.  
You can filter requests by file type (JSON, HTML, JS, etc.), search response bodies for keywords,  
and export them as **cURL** or **Python requests** code for easy reuse.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Capture **all network requests** from a given URL.
- Filter responses by **file type** (`json`, `html`, `js`, `css`, `xml`, `txt`, or `other`).
- Search response bodies for **keywords** (comma separated).
- Export requests as:
  - **cURL commands**
  - **Python `requests` snippets**
- View **response body snippets** directly in the UI.
